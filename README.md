# Analysis of CitiBike Data

## Overview

The purpose of the analysis is to use CitiBike data from New York to see if it is worth investing in a ride sharing program in Des Moines. For this we used data for the month of August as that is when ridership will be at its highest due to the weather conditions. 

The data is presented using Tableau Public. The presentation can be found by clicking [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/saudia8025/viz/CitiBike_16277480568100/CitiBikeDataChallengeStory#1)
